## What is Mushroom dashboard strategy ?

Mushroom dashboard strategy provides a strategy for Home assistant to automatically create a dashboard using Mushroom cards, the area configuration and entity configuration.

My goal is to propose a way to create powerful dashaboards without the need of spending hours manualy creating them.

### Features

-   üõ† Automatically create dashboard with 3 lines of yaml
-   üòç Built-in Views for device specific controls
-   üé® Many options to customize to your needs

## Installation

### HACS

Mushroom dashboard strategy is available in [HACS][hacs] (Home Assistant Community Store).

1. Install HACS if you don't have it already
2. Open HACS in Home Assistant
3. Go to "Frontend" section
4. Click button with "+" icon
5. Search for "Mushroom strategy"

### Manual

1. Download `mushroom-strategy.js` file from the [latest-release].
2. Put `mushroom-strategy.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `mushroom-strategy.js` in Dashboard. There's two way to do that:
    - **Using UI:** _Settings_ ‚Üí _Dashboards_ ‚Üí _More Options icon_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí _Add Resource_ ‚Üí Set _Url_ as `/local/mushroom-strategy.js` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
        ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: /local/mushroom-strategy.js
              type: module
        ```
## Preresquisites

You need to install these cards first before using this strategy
- [Mushroom cards][mushroom]
- [Mini graph card][mini-graph]
- [Web RTC][webrtc]

## Usage

All the Rounded cards can be configured using Dashboard UI editor.

1. In Dashboard UI, click 3 dots in top right corner.
2. Click _Edit Dashboard_.
3. Click 3 dots again
4. Click `Raw configuration editor`
5. Add these lines
```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:mushroom-strategy
views: []
```
